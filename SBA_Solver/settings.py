# Usage Notes
# The sba_template_name specified in this setting MUST have the following:
# 1. A single portfolio named 'Inforce Portfolio' (this can be changed by changing the projection update template below)
# 2. The proper reinvestment strategy must be set up on the specified template
# 3. The asset scaling variable needs to be set on the Projection Portfolio
# 4. The Portfolio Parameters Table that is used should include Initial Asset Scaling Type of '4' in the data table
# 5. The Company Properties Table should be set to
#       Capital Method 'None',
#       Distribute Earnings: False
#       Tax Rate: 0
